## Block, Layout, Templates Assignment

Controller Class 'Info' has been added to control the display of the
http:\\[HOST]/greeter/index/info page. A 'Info' Block class and template file
have also been added to display:

* The Datetime
* Current Magento store code
* Current Magento locale
* Magento base directory

Each line is a different colour and font size which is specified in the 
view/web/css/info.css file. The css is inserted into the head of the page
using the layout file greeter_index_info.xml and is also used to insert the 
block in to the content of the page.
